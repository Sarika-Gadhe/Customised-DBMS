# 🗄️ Customized DBMS in Java

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Custom Database Management System (DBMS)** developed in **Java**.  
It demonstrates the internal working of a DBMS by implementing essential features like **data storage, retrieval, query parsing, and manipulation**.  

The goal of this project is to provide a **lightweight and educational** alternative to traditional DBMS software, helping students and developers understand **how databases work under the hood**.
